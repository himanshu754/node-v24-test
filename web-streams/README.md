# ðŸŒŠ Node.js 24 Web Streams Demo

This project showcases how to use the **Web Streams API** in **Node.js 24** to read, transform, and write large files efficiently using native streams.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `generate-big-file.js` â€“ Creates a large dummy file for testing
- `stream-transform.js` â€“ Reads the file, transforms it (to uppercase), and writes output
- `hello.txt` â€“ A small sample file for simple testing

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Ensure you're using **Node.js v24+**
2. Run the generator to create a test file:
    ```bash
    node generate-big-file.js
    ```
3. Run the stream pipeline:
    ```bash
    node stream-transform.js
    ```
